OVERVIEW
========

Pointing your browser at
``file:///home/<user>/<project_path>/index.html`` 
provides a webapp interface developed to meet the
need of preparing a utility invoice.  Its input (which
the user provides using a file selector button) is a JSON
file of the form of the included ``json.txt`` file.  Once
file is loaded the user can activate processing using a
``Calculate`` button and if the JSON is parsed successfully
into meaningful data, the output is pesented.  Numerous
readings (a minimum of two!) can be supplied to provide 
access to historical data.

A sister project done in Python 3 can be found here:
``https://github.com/alexKleider/util_calc``

The code is released under the terms of the **GNU Public License**
of your choosing.

The author would welcome comments or questions should any arise.
